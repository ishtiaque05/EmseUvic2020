# Week 10: Collaboration, Communication and Knowledge Flow in Software Engineering

Date: Nov 13th, 2020
(See [Connex]( https://connex.csc.uvic.ca/portal/site/emse2020) for link to Zoom, you need to use your UVic ID to access Connex)

## Lecture Topics/Objectives

- Understand how knowledge flows in software development and how to address challenges with documentation
- Learn how to build online communities and successful remote teams
- Learn about a socio-technical coordination theory, why it matters and how to use it
- Gain experience with coding qualitative data (and how it can bring insights about group communication)

## Activity
- Qualitative coding exercise (details to be added)

## Preclass Homework

There will be some preparation for the class activity (details will be posted).

Write a blogpost on the preworkshop assigned materials in advance of the lecture 
(to be completed by 6pm the day before the workshop --> Thursday).
Your blogpost should include at least one discussion question per assigned reading/video/podcast.

Copy at most one question per guest to the relevant Slack channel and like other questions from your peers you think should be asked of our guests 
(we can't ask all of them!). 
The course staff will curate/group them on Thursday evening starting at 6pm. 
You may (and are encouraged to) update your blogpost after the workshop (but in a separate section of the post). 
The final version of your blogpost (should you improve it) is due by the following Monday at 6pm.
