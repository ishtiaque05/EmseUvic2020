## Activity
- No Activity this week

## Preclass Homework

Write a blogpost on the preworkshop assigned materials in advance of the lecture. 
(to be completed by 6pm the day before the workshop --> Thursday).
Your blogpost should include at least one discussion question per assigned reading/video/podcast.

Copy at most one question per guest to the relevant Slack channel and like other questions from your peers you think should be asked of our guests 
(we can't ask all of them!). 
The course staff will curate/group them on Thursday evening starting at 6pm. 
You may (and are encouraged to) update your blogpost after the workshop (but in a separate section of the post). 
The final version of your blogpost (should you improve it) is due by the following Monday at 6pm.
