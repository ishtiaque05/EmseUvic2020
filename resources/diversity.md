Date: Oct 30th, 2020
(See [Connex]( https://connex.csc.uvic.ca/portal/site/emse2020) for link to Zoom, you need to use your UVic ID to access Connex)

## Lecture Objectives

- Understand some of today's challenges with diversity and inclusion in software engineering and why caring about this matters
- Learn about how empirical studies can bring insights on the challenges and on interventions that can be used to address these challenges
- Know how to discuss these issues in your future jobs and job interviews, and what you can do to help address these challenges

## Preclass Homework

Write a blogpost on the preworkshop assigned materials in advance of the lecture 
(to be completed by 6pm the day before the workshop --> Thursday).
Suggestion for this week's blogpost (by Alexander Serebrenik):  Perhaps you have experienced or witnessed a diversity and inclusion challenge or problem (e.g., wrt race, gender, culture, ability, age, education background etc) in software engineering or some other aspect of your education. If you wish, you may wish to share this in your blogpost for this week.  
If not, then you may instead reflect on the assigned pre workshop materials and share what you learned.
Your blogpost should include at most one discussion question per assigned reading/video/podcast.

Copy these questions to the relevant Slack channel and like other questions you think should be asked of our guests (we can't ask all of them!). 
The course staff will curate/group them on Thursday evening starting at 6pm. 
You may (and are encouraged to) update your blogpost after the workshop (but in a separate section of the post). 
The final version of your blogpost (if you improve it) is due by the following Monday at 6pm.
