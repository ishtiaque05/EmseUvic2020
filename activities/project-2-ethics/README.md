# README

Hello! If you're here, it means you've chosen to do human-related research for your project 2.
Prior to conducting any human-centric research, you will need to fill out and submit an ethics application to your instructor.
This handy guide will walk you through writing up an ethics application using the resources provided here in the repository.
However, do not forget the following:
_Keep in mind that the topic you select must pose minimal risk to you and the participants according to the COVID-19 safe and gradual resumption of human participant research guidelines set by UVic. Consequently, all interviews and human interaction will be conducted remotely via tools such as Zoom or Skype._

## Why an Ethics Application is Required

**From the [project 2](https://github.com/margaretstorey/EmseUvic2020/blob/master/requirements.md#project-2) description:**
> If your project will involve a study with the direct participation of human subjects (e.g., developers or students or other stakeholders participating in a lab experiment, observations, focus group, interviews, surveys), you will need to submit a brief application for ethics approval.

An ethics application helps guarantee that the rights of the human subjects involved in your study are not ignored, and provides them with a level of comfort that the research conducted is held to an ethical standard specified by an independent authority.

### What Constitutes Direct Participation?

Direct participation means a human subject is involved in your research in any of the following ways:

- They are the main focus of your study in the sense that the information you are collecting describes them or measures their abilities, performance, ...etc.
- They are sources of information for your study in the sense that they can provide information on the phenomenon you are interested in studying.

_This includes trace-data and logs._

## How to Conduct Safe, Minimal Risk, Ethical Human-Centric Research

From the [UVic guidelines](./additional-resources/uvic_guidelines.pdf) which we wholeheartedly recommend you read:

**Minimal risk** means that, “the probability and magnitude of possible harms implied by participation in the research is no greater than those encountered by participants in those aspects of their everyday life that relate to the research.” (TCPS2 Chapter 2.B)

**Participants Involved in Student Research Activities**

- Participants are usually competent adults, youth, or children
- Participants live freely in the community (i.e., not hospitalized, do not reside in prison)
- Participants are not considered vulnerable, or, where a vulnerability is identified, it is not the focus of the research and complex risk mitigation plans are not required.

**Characteristics of Research Activities**

- The choice of research activities and methods identified by instructors and selected by students must be non-invasive, such as the use of observations, questionnaires, focus groups, or interviews. Invasive activities, requiring a Standard Application, could include the student collecting blood samples, human tissues etc. This will depend on the pedagogical aims of the course (e.g., the course teaches biology students how to collect and analyze blood spots for certain proteins.)
- The research activities do not involve the use of deception.

**Topics and Risk to Participants and Potential Risks to the Students Conducting Research Activities**

- The activities to be conducted with the participants (e.g., the kinds of questions they are posed in an interview) present little or no risk to them.
- The student conducting the activities are not themselves exposed to risks.
- The topic areas that students propose to the instructor fall within the instructor’s realm of expertise such that the instructor has the background to provide training and support to the student(s).
- Research risks do not outweigh benefits.

**When students in the course are research participants for each other:**

- A Course-based Application is required when students collect data from other students enrolled together in the same course (e.g., students interview each other, analyze data collected from each other). The reason is that students are conducting human research regardless of being enrolled together in the same course.

For more details on how to conduct safe and minimal risk research, see the [UVic guidelines document](./additional-resources/uvic_guidelines.pdf) included in the course repository.

## Templates

We have prepared several templates that you can use for your research. These can be found in the `templates` folder.

### Ethics Application Template

[This file](./templates/ethics_application.docx) is what you will need to fill out to submit an ethics application for your project. For your convenience, it is available as a `.docx` file.
However, upon submission, please make sure to submit a PDF version of your completed application.

### Consent Form Templates

Depending on your data collection method, you will need certain types of consent forms:

- For interviews, focus groups, observations, and other data collection methods that require one-on-one interaction with human subjects, you will be expected to modify and use the [interview consent form](./templates/consent_form_signable.docx) which you can find in the `templates` folder named `consent_form_signable.docx`. You will modify the existing template, and create a PDF version which you will then send to subjects who have agreed to participate in your study. They will be expected to sign it electronically, typically via Adobe Reader, and return the signed version to you. You will then send copies of all signed consent forms to the instructor.
- For questionnaires, and other data collection methods that do not necessitate a one-to-one interaction with subjects, you will be expected to include a link to your version of the [implicit consent form](./templates/consent_form_implicit.docx) which you can find in the `templates` folder named `consent_form_implicit.docx`. That link should be included in your questionnaire's preamble, or depending on the tool, you may need to use a signable consent form.

### Recruitment Email Template

Should you need it, we've also prepared a [recruitment email template](./templates/recruitment_email.template.docx) for you to use as a basis for your recruitment emails. Like other templates, you can find this in the `templates` folder as a `docx` file.

## What and How Should I Submit?

Your typical ethics application package should include the following:

- Filled out ethics application document based on your project's needs.
- Filled out consent form(s) based on your project's needs.
- Any supplementary material you mention in your application that you feel is necessary for us to understand how you plan on conducting your research in an ethical manner.

You can send us the above material via Slack, preferably as a `.zip` archive.
