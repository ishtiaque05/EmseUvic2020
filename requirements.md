# Prereqs and Requirements

**Prerequisites:**

- Reserved for students in the BSENG program or Computer Science students with Software Systems option, or graduate students with previous software engineering education or experience
- SENG 275 and one of SENG 350/360/371 for undergraduates (equivalent for graduate students)
- Minimum 4th year standing

**General Requirements:**

- This is a senior seminar style class assuming a professional approach to the course in terms of attendance and participation in the class and course
- Attendance in all class meetings (lectures, project #1 alignment session, and workshops) during the scheduled timeslot is **mandatory**. If you have to miss a class, please let the instructor know ahead of time.  Some classes may start or end early depending on the nature of the topic covered and available materials to be viewed offline.  Details will be posted on Slack in advance of the lecture (you should assume the lecture will consume the entire scheduled class time unless you hear otherwise).
- Readings/videos/podcasts will be assigned weekly and should be read/viewed/listened to in **advance** of the lectures and workshops.
- Blogposts must be finalized and submitted by 6pm on their due dates.
- There are no extensions for project deliverables. See below for information on how to submit the project deliverables.
- See the [course outlines](https://heat.csc.uvic.ca/coview/course/2020091/CSC578A) for other expectations, course policies, and official grade breakdown.
- Monitor messages on Slack for any changes in course delivery methods, tools used, project requirements and due dates.

#### Course participation:

There will be ample group activities throughout the term and opportunities to contribute to the course material and class discussions.  It can be hard to focus during a long class, consider using [sketchnotes](https://medium.com/workday-design/sketchnotes-for-conferences-how-to-stay-awake-and-engaged-5651333d31d6) (as [one of our students is doing!](https://twitter.com/margaretstorey/status/1315043979805638657)) or follow these tips on [notetaking from UVic](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/lap/note-taking/).

# [Blogposts](#workshops)

For each of our workshops, you will write a short blogpost of approx. 3-4 paragraphs based on your reflections of the assigned materials (readings/videos/podcasts) for that workshop.
Note, this post should not be merely a summary of the readings but your personal reflection of how these relate to your own experience and knowledge, and the content discussed earlier in the course. Your post should make it clear though that you've read and thought about these materials in preparation for the workshop.

In addition, each blogpost should list at most one clearly stated question per assigned material/guest.

The blogposts are due by 6pm the day before each workshop (Thursday).
You may update your posts with additional thoughts and reflections during the workshop (e.g., how your question was answered explicitly or indirectly).
Please make any changes by the following Monday at 6pm and make sure we can easily identify the changed content.

We will be using [Wordpress](https://emseuvic2020.wordpress.com) as a platform for your blogposts. Categories representing the different weeks have already been created. When you author a post related to a particular week in the course, please assign it the appropriate category as well.

### Blog Post Quality Criteria

Main aspects considered:
- Title is appropriate, added appropriate category
- Introduction (some opening remark)
- Background (based on assigned papers for the week, some mention of each)
- Materials referenced are added as references (at bottom or throughout as links)
- Questions (per assigned reading, that are not already answered by the assigned readings!) 
- Conclusion/Takeaway/Some closing remark 
- Appropriate use of typography, well-formatted (uses headers/sections, ...etc.)
- Easy to follow post (cohesive, clear in communicating its ideas)
- On time, questions (at most one per guest) copied to Slack on time

*If the above aspects are covered, this would be deserving of a B+ grade (7.5/10).*

Lower grades will be assigned if not all aspects are covered.
Marks will be deducted for late posts. 

Extra marks would be given for:
- It has a good "Hook" that entices your reader to read your post (with a good title)
- Post is interesting to read and the reader will want to continue reading
- References to other related materials (if relevant, don't just add these for the sake of it, they really need to be on point and add something)
- References to previous materials discussed in the course (if relevant, again they should be on point and add something)
- Visual aids/graphic design (if relevant to the post!)
- Was the post updated with reflections or new insights gained during the workshop (e.g., from an extra talk, or activity)
- Insightfulness and creativity:
   - Did the post communicate something we did not know or learn already in the course?  
   - The post has a clear thesis statement that is insightful and thought provoking
   - Did the writer incorporate their own experiences into the post to make/emphasize their point?
   - Do I, having read the post, have more questions than I did before reading it? (is it thought provoking?)
- Are the questions for the guests based on the readings insightful, thought-provoking, and could possibly lead to future research or more discussion?
- Note that longer isn't necessarily better!  The best posts will often communicate some key ideas/insights in a few lines!
- Note that for an A+ mark (9/10 or higher) the criteria as per course outline is: "Exceptional work. Technically flawless and original work demonstrating insight, understanding and independent application or extension of course expectations; often publishable." In this case, publishable would mean this would be at the level of a professional or publishable post (e.g, on medium or other blog). 

Some tips: 
- If you want to improve your writing skills, do consult the writing department at UVic.  They give excellent advice and will give you feedback on your writing.  For this course that is maybe not urgent, but it will help you in the future! 
- Also there are blogposts out there about how to write a blogpost! You may get some ideas from reading those and reading other student posts.
- Do consider reposting your posts in your own public blog!  It is a great way to get feedback and build a portfolio of your ability to write, share information and synthesize knowledge. If you are interesting, it would be greak to link to any public posts you add from this page!


# [Project #1](#project1)

For this project we will conduct a review of papers published at the flagship conference in software engineering in 2020.

This isn't a traditional review of the papers that authors would receive for their papers when submitted to a conference,
but rather our goal is (as a class) to determine answers to the following questions about these papers:
- who are the claimed **beneficiaries** of the reported research, that is by the authors (see the WWH framework);
- what kinds of **knowledge** are captured in these papers in terms of descriptive or prescriptive knowledge (see our reading on Design Science);
- which empirical **research methods** (if any) are used in the papers and how do the methods used meet the quality criteria of **generalizability, control, precision and realism** (see readings by McGrath and the WWH framework), or is the research non empirical (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence)
- which **software engineering topics** do these papers cover (according to the topics specified by [Swebok](https://cs.fit.edu/~kgallagher/Schtick/Serious/SWEBOKv3.pdf) and used in the Lenberg systematic mapping paper we discussed);
- for the empirical papers, how do the authors convince the readers that their research and findings are **novel, rigorous, and relevant** to others (see Design science paper);
- what is your personal opinion of the **importance** of this research.

You will each be assigned a set of papers from the [ICSE 2020 technical track](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2020/icse-2020-papers?track=ICSE%20Technical%20Papers#event-overview). Your task is to read and think critically about each of these papers, and answer the above set of questions for each of them (there are also some bonus questions!).
Graduate students will be assigned 11 papers; undergraduate students will be assigned 7 papers.
Note that several of the questions ask you to elaborate on your decisions for type of paper etc, for many of these you can copy/paste quotes directly from the papers you are reading.
To submit your individual answers for each paper, please use this form: https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/emseuvic for each of your assigned papers.
Make sure you fill out the form for the correct paper (select the paper carefully in the survey pulldown box).
Meeting the milestones (you will review some papers each week) is important so that we can give you feedback along the way if we notice some misunderstanding about the project requirements. You can resubmit your surveys as we will use the latest versions but you may only update them up to Nov 6th.

Each paper will have two or three "reviewers".  In the second phase, your task with be to "align" your answers with the other reviewer.
This may not always be easy, so make sure you have a solid justification for your choices to some of the questions.
For this phase, we will use a giant google spreadsheet to record our alignment activity (when you disagree with the other reviewer, you will need to say why you disagree) and we will finally visualize the results as a class!

You will be assigned your paper sets via Slack. A complete list of papers is given in the [paper_list_sorted.txt](activities/paper_list_sorted.txt) file.
You can download the papers from this link to a public [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PNjV_lvKmtTtu0pbDuoZnv3Htu1HvUfc?usp=sharing).


#### Project #1 Milestones and Grading

| Date | Graduate Students | Undergraduate Students|
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Oct 14, 6pm | 3 papers | 2 papers |
| Oct 21, 6pm | 3 papers | 2 papers |
| Oct 28, 6pm | 3 papers | 2 papers |
| Nov 3, 6pm | 2 papers | 1 paper |
| Nov 6, due by 6pm | Prepare for/do alignment | Prepare for/do alignment |

The individual work of this assignment is worth 80% of the project #1 grade (interim milestones must be followed).
This part will be graded according to the effort you put into reviewing these papers.

The **collaborative alignment phase** should ideally be finished by the end of class time on Nov 6th.
This phase is worth 20% of your project #1 grade (this will be graded based on the amount of attention/discussion you put into the alignment and coming to consensus with other students). 

You should do some homework and prepare for this alignment activity (before our class acitivty) and look over your reviews as well as the reviews from other students (this will help to ensure our classtime is used more effectively).  We aim to have these ready for you to review by Thursday morning Nov 5th.

# [Project #2](#project2)

For this project, you will conduct a replication of an existing study published in a software engineering research venue, or you may wish to design a novel study.
The project should ideally be completed in teams of 3-4 students, but students can complete it alone or in pairs if they wish.  The main contribution from this project is about the empirical aspects. 

If your project will involve a study with the direct participation of human subjects (e.g., developers or students or other stakeholders participating in a lab experiment, observations, focus group, interviews, surveys), you will need to submit a brief application for ethics approval.  We will post details on this process here shortly.  We will guide you this process (you cannot change your mind on this aspect after Nov 16th). Note you cannot use deception as part of this study.

Please note that this project should be independent from other course projects you have done previously or that you are currently doing, and it should also be independent from research work you have done or are doing for your graduate degree (the reason is that determining what is unique in terms of the contribution for this course becomes problematic). If you are unsure about this aspect, do talk to your instructor about this. 

For some ideas of projects you can replicate that are based on data traces only, you may get some ideas from this book: http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/ (see also
https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-book).  Or you may wish to replicate a study from an existing paper that has replication materials available. GHTorrent is another possibility but pay attention to the Perils paper we read by Kalliamvakou et al.!



#### Project #2 Miletones and Grading

| Date | Milestone | % of Project Grade |
| ------------ | ----------------| --------------------- |
| Nov 16, 6pm | Project proposal | 10% |
| Nov 30, 6pm | Interim report | 20% |
| Dec 4, 9am | Video presentation | 20% |
| Dec 11, 6pm | Final report | 50% |


#### Project proposal

Format:  PDF document, submitted via Connex. 1-2 pages. See due date above.

This should describe the study you wish to replicate or new study you wish to design with the following information:
- Team members (if any)
- Motivation
- Research goal or question
- Research Strategies
- Potential Limitations
- Expected Results
- Core References

The proposal should be considered as a working document.  You will likely update it after I have a chance to read what you plan and we can discuss your next steps. Also I'd be thrilled to see early versions of this and give feedback sooner than later (and you can refine and resubmit by the deadline).  


#### Project interim reports

Format: PDF document, submitted via Connex. This will be in the 3-4 page range using the ACM format described here: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template  See due date above.

The interim project report should be a stand-alone document describing your progress so far on the project. Consider it as an early (but incomplete) preliminary version of your final report (see below). It should include early versions of most sections of the anticipated final report.

#### Project video
- Approx. 5 min video describing your project (motivation, methods, what you learned, what's next).  You may wish to host this on YouTube (or Vimeo) and submit the link via Connex.
- See the table above for due date for the video.  This should show your work done by that date.

#### Project final report

Format: PDF document, submitted via Connex. This will be in the 8-12 page range (not including appendices). Use the format described at this page: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. See due date above in the table.

The following shows a typical outline, but your project may require a different outline.  Check with the course staff if you are unsure!
- Introduction
   - Motivation for this research, to whom is it relevant and why
- Related work (this may come later in your paper!)
   - Brief literature review on this topic
- Research questions and methodology
- Results or Findings
- Discussion
- Limitations
- Conclusion/Future work
- References
- Appendix A: describe and provide links to any supplementary materials or replication package.
- Appendix B: if this was does as a team, please include a description of how the team members contributed to the project.

#### Project #2 Advice
Each student/team member is required to do the following:

1. Follow any updates on this site and meet all of the established interim milestones.
2. Attend all the lectures during the semester, as these will prepare you to succeed in this project.
3. Together with your team mates (if any), choose a topic for your project (details to follow).
4. Contribute equitably throughout the term to the team project in terms of research, video and paper writing.
5. Grade will be determined on a combination of the following:
    - 20% of your grade for this project component will be given for presentation in class (prepared video)
    - 80% of your grade will be based on the final report and meeting milestones throughout the term
    - Extra points may be given for: challenging projects, original ideas, collaboration with external organizations.
